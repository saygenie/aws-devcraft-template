# Amazon States Language

This document describes a [JSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259 "RFC 8259")-based
language used to describe state machines declaratively. The state machines thus
defined may be executed by software. In this document, the software is referred
to as "the interpreter".

## Structure of a State Machine

A State Machine is represented by a [JSON
Object](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-4 "RFC 8259 JSON Object").

### Example: Hello World

The operation of a state machine is specified by states, which are
represented by JSON objects, fields in the top-level "States" object. In
this example, there is one state named "Hello World".

```
{
  "Comment": "A simple minimal example of the States language",
  "StartAt": "Hello World",
  "States": {
    "Hello World": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:HelloWorld",
      "End": true
    }
  }
}

```

When this state machine is launched, the interpreter begins execution by
identifying the Start State. It executes that state, and then checks to
see if the state is marked as an End State. If the state is an End State, the interpreter
terminates the machine and returns its result. If the state is not an End State, the
interpreter looks for a "Next" field, or a "Default" field in a Choice
State, to determine which state to execute
next; it repeats this process until the machine reaches a [Terminal
State](https://states-language.net/#terminal-state) (Succeed, Fail, or an End State) or a runtime
error occurs.

In this example, the machine contains a single state named "Hello
World". Because "Hello World" is a Task State, the interpreter tries to
execute it. Examining the value of the "Resource" field shows that it
points to a Lambda function, so the interpreter attempts to invoke that
function. Assuming the Lambda function executes successfully, the
machine will terminate successfully.

### Top-level fields

A State Machine MUST have an object field named "States", whose fields
represent the states.

A State Machine MUST have a string field named "StartAt", whose value
MUST match exactly the name of one of the "States" fields. The interpreter
starts executing the machine at the named state.

A State Machine MAY have a string field named "QueryLanguage", which
provides the name of the *query language* used in the machine. A
query language is a language used to query, transform, or create JSON data. The
States Language supports JSONPath and JSONata, and if omitted, the
default value of "QueryLanguage" is "JSONPath". This document refers
to the value of the top-level "QueryLanguage" field as the "state
machine's query language".

A State Machine MAY have a string field named "Comment", to hold a
human-readable comment or description of the machine.

A State Machine MAY have a string field named "Version", which gives the
version of the States Language used in the machine. This document
describes version 1.0, and if omitted, the default value of "Version" is
"1.0".

A State Machine MAY have an integer field named "TimeoutSeconds". If
provided, it provides the maximum number of seconds the machine is
allowed to execute. If the machine executes longer than the specified time, then
the interpreter fails the machine with a `States.Timeout` [Error
Name](https://states-language.net/#error-names).

## Concepts

### States

States describe tasks (units of work), or specify flow control (for
example, a Choice State) and are represented as fields of the
top-level "States" object. The state name is the JSON field name. The
state name MUST be unique within the scope of the entire state
machine, and its length MUST BE less than or equal to 80 Unicode
characters.

The following shows an example state definition:

```
"HelloWorld": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "QueryLanguage": "JSONPath",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:HelloWorld",
  "Next": "NextState",
  "Comment": "Executes the HelloWorld Lambda function"
}

```

Note that:

1. All states MUST have a "Type" field. This document refers to the
   values of this field as a state’s *type*, and to a state such as the
   one in the previous example as a Task State.
2. Any state MAY have a "Comment" field, to hold a human-readable
   comment or description.
3. Any state MAY have a "QueryLanguage" field to override the state
   machine's query language as specified in the top-level
   "QueryLanguage" field. This document refers to the value of a
   state's "QueryLanguage" field (or the state machine's query
   language if not provided) as a "state's query language", and to a
   state such as the one in the previous example as a JSONPath Task
   State.
4. Most state types require additional fields as specified in this
   document.
5. Any state except for Choice, Succeed, and
   Fail MAY have a field named "End" whose value MUST be a boolean. The term
   "Terminal State" means a state with `{ "End": true }`, or a state with
   `{ "Type": "Succeed" }`, or a state with `{ "Type": "Fail" }`.

### Transitions

Transitions link states together, defining the control flow for the
state machine. After executing a non-terminal state, the interpreter
follows a transition to the next state. For most state types,
transitions are unconditional and specified through the state's "Next"
field.

All non-terminal states MUST have a "Next" field, except for the Choice
State. The value of the "Next" field MUST exactly and case-sensitively
match the name of another state.

States can have multiple incoming transitions from other states.

### Timestamps

The Choice and Wait States deal with JSON field values which represent
timestamps. These are strings which MUST conform to the
[RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt "RFC 3339") profile of ISO 8601,
with the further restrictions that an uppercase "T" character MUST be
used to separate date and time, and an uppercase "Z" character MUST be
present in the absence of a numeric time zone offset, for example
"2016-03-14T01:59:00Z".

### Data

The interpreter passes data between states to perform calculations or to
dynamically control the state machine’s flow. All such data MUST be
expressed in JSON. This document uses the term "JSON text" as defined
in [RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-2 "RFC 8259 JSON Text")
to refer to
data expressed in JSON.

When a state machine is started, the caller can provide an initial JSON
text as input, which is
passed to the machine's start state as input. If no input is provided,
the default is an empty JSON object, `{}`. As each state is executed, it
receives a JSON text as input and can produce arbitrary output, which
MUST be a JSON text. When two states are linked by a transition, the
output from the first state is passed as input to the second state. The
output from the machine's terminal state is treated as its output.

For example, consider a simple state machine that adds two numbers
together:

```
{
  "StartAt": "Add",
  "States": {
    "Add": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:Add",
      "End": true
    }
  }
}

```

Suppose the "Add" Lambda function is defined as:

```
export const handler = async (event) => {
  return event.val1 + event.val2;
};

```

Then if this state machine was started with the input
`{ "val1": 3, "val2": 4 }`, then the output would be the JSON text
consisting of the number `7`.

The usual constraints applying to JSON-encoded data apply. In
particular, note that:

1. Numbers in JSON generally conform to JavaScript semantics, typically
   corresponding to double-precision IEEE-854 values. For this and
   other interoperability concerns, see [RFC
   8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259 "RFC 8259").
2. Standalone quote-delimited (") strings, booleans, and numbers are valid JSON
   texts.

### The Context Object

The interpreter can provide information to an executing state machine
about the execution and other implementation details. This is delivered
in the form of a JSON object called the "Context Object". This version
of the States Language specification does not specify any contents of
the Context Object.

### Query Languages

A query language is a language used to query, transform, or create JSON
text. A state machine's query language defaults to JSONPath.
The interpreter MUST support
[JSONPath](https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath "JSONPath") and
[JSONata](https://jsonata.org/ "JSONata"), and MAY support others.

A state machine specifies its query language in the
[top-level "QueryLanguage" field](https://states-language.net/#toplevelfields), which overrides the default and sets the
query language for every state in the state machine. For example:

```
{
  "QueryLanguage": "JSONata",
  "StartAt": "Hello World",
  "States": {
    "Hello World": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:HelloWorld",
      "End": true
    }
  }
}

```

A state MAY have a "QueryLanguage" field to override the default. For
example:

```
{
  "QueryLanguage": "JSONPath",
  "StartAt": "JSONPath state",
  "States": {
    "JSONPath state": {
      "Type": "Pass",
      "Parameters": {
        "total.$": "$.transaction.total"
      },
      "Next": "JSONata state"
    },
    "JSONata state": {
      "Type": "Pass",
      "QueryLanguage": "JSONata",
      "Output": {
        "total": "{% $states.input.transaction.total %}"
      },
      "End": true
    }
  }
}

```

The "JSONPath state" does not have a "QueryLanguage" field, so it
defaults to "JSONPath" as specified in the top-level "QueryLanguage" field. This state
contains a "Parameters" field which is specific to JSONPath, and which
contains JSONPath features and syntax.

The "JSONata state" has its own "QueryLanguage" field set to
"JSONata", so it overrides the state machine's
query language. This state contains an "Output" field which is
specific to JSONata, and which contains JSONata features and syntax.

If a Map or Parallel State has a "QueryLanguage" field, the default
query language for each state inside the Map's "ItemProcessor" or the
Parallel's "Branches" fields is the state machine's query language,
and is independent of the Map or Parallel State's query language.

The interpreter MAY restrict specific combinations of the top-level
"QueryLanguage" field and a state's "QueryLanguage" field.

This document describes the names, syntax, and semantics of fields
specific to JSONPath or JSONata. See
[JSONPath Concepts](https://states-language.net/#jsonpath-concepts) and
[JSONata Concepts](https://states-language.net/#jsonata-concepts) for details.

### State Machine Variables

A state machine variable is a named JSON value. Instead of passing data
between states, a state can store data in a variable and reference it
in a later state.

Each variable name, whose length MUST BE less than or equal to 80
Unicode characters, MUST follow the rules for Unicode Identifiers as
described in
[Unicode Standard Annex #31](https://unicode.org/reports/tr31 "Unicode Standard Annex 31"). The
first character of a variable name MUST be a Unicode ID\_Start
character, and the second and subsequent characters MUST be Unicode
ID\_Continue characters.

This document uses the term "state machine variable" to describe a variable
assigned in a state using the ["Assign" field](https://states-language.net/#assigning-variables).
Some query languages, such as JSONata, support variable assignment
inside an expression, but a variable assigned inside an expression
does not affect the value of any state machine variable. The only
way a state can assign a value to a state machine variable is with the
"Assign" field.

Any state except Succeed and Fail MAY assign a value to one or more
state machine variables, and any state MAY reference the value of any
variable that has a value on state entry. All references to a state
machine variable in a state refer to the same value, which is the
value it had at state entry, as described in the
[Variable Scope section](https://states-language.net/#variable-scope).

This specification defines one reserved variable called "states" whose
value depends on the query language. A state MUST NOT assign a value
to "states".

In a JSONPath state, the "ResultPath" field MUST NOT reference a
variable.

#### Assigning State Machine Variables

Any state except Succeed and Fail MAY have an "Assign" field at the
state's top level. Any Choice Rule in a
Choice State, and any Catcher in a Task, Map, or Parallel state, MAY
have an "Assign" field. An "Assign" field can
assign a value to one or more variables. The value of an "Assign"
field MUST be a JSON object; it has no required fields. The name of
each top-level field in the object names a variable to assign, and the
field's value provides its new value.

For example:

```
"FirstState": {
  "Type": "Pass",
  "Assign": {
    "make": "Infiniti",
    "model": "G35",
    "year": 2006
  },
  "Next": "SecondState"
}

```

In this example, the state assigns `"Infiniti"` to the variable `make`,
`"G35"` to `model`, and `2006` to `year`. Any state that executes
after "FirstState" can reference these variables using a syntax that
depends on the query language. For JSONPath and JSONata, variables
are referenced by prepending the variable name with a "$", as in
`$make`,`$model`, and `$year`. In this example, the state uses
JSONata syntax to output a string that includes all three variable
values.

```
"SecondState": {
  "Type": "Pass",
  "QueryLanguage": "JSONata",
  "Output": "{% $year & ' ' & $make & ' ' & $model %}",
  "Next": "ThirdState"
}

```

In this example, the output of "SecondState" would be `"2006 Infiniti G35"`.

Any variable referenced in an "Assign" field sees its current value as
it was when the state was entered, and each variable's new value only takes
effect in the next state. For example:

```
"Assigning": {
  "Type": "Pass",
  "QueryLanguage": "JSONata",
  "Assign": {
    "x": 42,
    "newOrOld": "{% $x %}"
  },
  "Next": "Referencing"
}

```

If variable `x` had the value `5` on state entry, the interpreter will
assign `42` to `x`, and `5` to `newOrOld`. The JSONata string for
`newOrOld` references `$x`, but the interpreter evaluates the
expression using the current value of `x`, which is `5`. The new
value of `x` (`42`) will only take effect in the next state.

#### Variable Scope

The interpreter places each variable into a state-machine-local scope,
which this document simply refers to as a *scope*. A
state-machine-local scope includes all states inside a "States" field,
not including states inside Parallel or Map states in that scope. For
example, the states inside a Map state's "States" field are in a
separate, inner scope from the Map state's scope. A variable exists
in a scope if any state in the scope assigns a value to it. A state
MAY reference the value of any variable in its scope that has a value on
state entry.

The interpreter maintains separate variable values for each
scope, including for each Parallel branch and Map
iteration. In a Parallel state, a state in one branch MUST NOT
reference any variable assigned in another branch. In a Map state, a
state in one iteration MUST NOT reference any variable assigned in
another iteration.

The interpreter MAY allow states in inner scopes to reference
variables from outer scopes. However, states in inner scopes MUST NOT
assign to a variable with the same name as a variable in an outer
scope. Put another way, the names of outer-scoped and inner-scoped
variables MUST be unique. For example:

```
{
  "QueryLanguage": "JSONata",
  "StartAt": "Get Greeting",
  "States": {
    "Get Greeting": {
      "Type": "Pass",
      "Assign": {
        "outer": "hello"
      },
      "Next": "Greet Everyone"
    },
    "Greet Everyone": {
      "Type": "Map",
      "ItemProcessor": {
        "StartAt": "Begin",
        "States": {
          "Begin": {
            "Type": "Pass",
            "Assign": {
              "inner": "world",
              "hi": "{% $outer %}"
            },
            "Next": "End"
          },
          "End": {
            "Type": "Succeed",
            "Output": "{% $hi %}"
          }
        }
      },
      "Assign": {
        "outer": 2
      },
      "Next": "Goodbye"
    },
    "Goodbye": {
      "Type": "Succeed",
      "Output": "{% $outer %}"
    }
  }
}

```

In this example, variable `outer` is in the outer scope because it is
assigned in a state inside the top-level "States" field, and variables
`inner` and `hi` are in the inner scope because they are assigned in a
state inside the inner "States" field. The "Get Greeting" and "Greet
Everyone" states can both assign to `outer` because they are in the
same outer scope. State "Begin" can reference `outer`, but since it
is in the inner scope, it cannot assign it.

State "End" will output the string `hello`, and state "Goodbye" will
output the number `2`.

When a Parallel branch or Map iteration completes, its
variables go out of scope and are no longer accessible. Parallel
branches and Map iterations can return results to the outer scope
through the state output of one of its terminal states.

## JSONata Concepts

When a state's query language is JSONata, the interpreter supports
fields and syntax for querying and transforming data using JSONata.
For information about JSONPath, see
[JSONPath Concepts](https://states-language.net/#jsonpath-concepts).

### Expressions

A JSONata expression can query, select, transform, and create JSON
data.

In the States Language, JSONata expressions are written inside strings
that start with `{%` and end with `%}`. The syntax of the text inside
the `{%` and `%}` delimiters is that of
[JSONata](https://jsonata.org/ "JSONata"). In JSONata,
any name that starts with "$" is a variable, so the value of `"{% $year %}"` is the current value of the `year` variable.
This document refers to `{% %}`-delimited JSONata expressions as
JSONata strings. When the interpreter evaluates a JSONata string, the
result is that of the JSONata expression inside the string.

JSONata has a built-in function library which JSONata expressions can
call, for example `"{% $sum($order.total) %}"`.
The interpreter MAY define other auxiliary JSONata functions and
values, and MAY restrict the use of built-in functions.

JSONata expressions can define their own functions, as with the
`$product` function in this calculation of 5 factorial:

```
"{% ($product := function($x, $y) {$x * $y}; $reduce([1..5], $product)) %}"`

```

A variable assigned inside a JSONata expression does not affect the
value of any state machine variable. Put another way, the only way to
assign a value to a state machine variable is with the "Assign" field.

### Reserved "states" Variable with JSONata

The States Language reserves one variable called "states". When the
query language is JSONata, the "states" variable is defined as a JSON
object containing fields defined by the interpreter as it executes
each state. A state MUST NOT assign a value to "states".

The "states" variable is a JSON object containing these fields:

```
{
  "input":        // The state input
  "result":       // The state's result
  "errorOutput":  // The Error Output in a Catch
  "context":      // The Context Object
}

```

`$states.input` refers to the state input, and `$states.context`
refers to the [Context Object](https://states-language.net/#context-object), both of which can be
referenced in any field that accepts JSONata.

`$states.result` refers to the result that a Task, Map, or Parallel
state returns, and can be referenced in the state's top-level "Output" and "Assign"
fields.

`$states.errorOutput` refers to the [Error Output](https://states-language.net/#error-output) the
interpreter generates when a Task, Map, or Parallel state reports an
error, and can be referenced in a Catcher's "Output" and "Assign" fields.

For example:

```
"My Task": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "QueryLanguage": "JSONata",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:HelloWorld",
  "Output": {
    "customer": "{% $states.input.customer %}",
    "resultStatus": "{% $states.result.status %}",
    "elapsedTime": "{% $states.context.ElapsedTime %}"
  },
  "Catch": [
    {
      "ErrorEquals": ["States.ALL"],
      "Output": {
        "errorDetails": "{% $states.errorOutput %}",
        "input": "{% $states.input %}"
      },
      "Next": "Handle Error"
    }
  ],
  "End": true
}

```

If the HelloWorld function succeeds, the state will output the JSON
object specified by the state's top-level "Output" field, containing the value
of the `customer` field from the state input, the `status` field from
the result of executing the HelloWorld function, and the `ElapsedTime`
field from the interpreter-defined Context Object.

If the HelloWorld function reports an error, the state will output the
JSON object specified by the Catcher's "Output" field,
which has an "errorDetails" field whose value is the Error Output, and an
"input" field whose value is the state input. See
[Error Handling](https://states-language.net/#error-handling) for
details.

### Input and Output Processing with JSONata

As described earlier, data is passed between states as JSON texts. A
state may need to control the format and content of the data it passes
to the external code of a Task State or the branches of a Parallel
State, or of the data it passes on as output. Fields named
"Arguments" and "Output" exist to support this.

Any state except Fail MAY have "Output".

Task and Parallel States MAY have "Arguments".

#### Using Arguments and Output

In this discussion, "state input" means the JSON text that is the
input to a state, "arguments" means the result of evaluating the
"Arguments" field, "result" means the JSON text that a state
generates, for example from external code invoked by a Task State, or
the combined result of the branches in a Parallel or Map State, and
"state output" means the final state output after processing the
result with the "Output" field.

The interpreter dispatches data as input to tasks to do
useful work, and receives output back from them. A common requirement
is to reshape input data to meet the format expectations of
tasks, and similarly to reshape the output coming back.

In the Task and Parallel States, the input to tasks is the value
of the "Arguments" field, and the result can be reshaped with the
"Output" field.

1. The value of "Arguments" MUST be a JSON text, or a JSONata string
   that evaluates to a JSON text. If the "Arguments" field is
   provided, its result becomes the arguments to the external code
   invoked by a Task State, or the branches of a Parallel
   State. If not provided, the arguments are the state input.
   "Arguments" MAY reference `$states.input` and `$states.context`,
   but MUST NOT reference `$states.result` or `$states.errorOutput`.
2. The value of "Output" MUST be a JSON text, or a JSONata string
   that evaluates to a JSON text. If the "Output" field is provided,
   its result becomes the state output, which serves as the state
   input for the next state. If not provided, the state output is
   the result in a Task, Map, and Parallel State, or the state input
   in all other states. In all states, "Output" MAY reference
   `$states.input` and `$states.context`. In Task, Map, and Parallel
   States, the state's top-level "Output" field MAY reference `$states.result`,
   and the Catcher's "Output" field MAY reference `$states.errorOutput`.

#### Using Assign

The value of an "Assign" field MUST be a JSON object; it has no
required fields. The name of each top-level field in the object names
a variable to assign, and the field's value provides its new value.

If an "Assign" field is provided, the interpreter first evaluates the
new value for each variable, and then performs the assignments. Any
variable referenced in an "Assign" field sees its current value as it
was when the state was entered, and each variable's new value only takes
effect in the next state.

In all states, "Assign" MAY reference `$states.input` and
`$states.context`. In Task, Map, and Parallel States, the state's top-level "Assign"
field MAY reference `$states.result`, and the Catcher's "Assign" field
MAY reference `$states.errorOutput`.

### JSONata Evaluation

In any field that accepts JSONata, if its
value, or any value nested inside a JSON object or array, is a JSONata
string, the interpreter evaluates the JSONata expression and then
replaces it with the result.

For example, suppose a state assigns these variables:

```
"GetSampleData": {
  "Type": "Pass",
  "Assign": {
    "student": {
      "name": "Scotland",
      "course": [
        { "grade": 34 },
        { "grade": 99 },
        { "grade": 76 },
        { "grade": 96 }
      ]
    },
    "class": {
      "teacher": "Bert"
    },
    "two": "the number 2"
  },
  "Next": "A Task"
}

```

And the next state references the variables in its "Arguments" and
"Output" fields:

```
"A Task": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "QueryLanguage": "JSONata",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:DoTheTask",
  "Arguments": {
    "student": "{% $student.name %}",
    "classInfo": {
      "teacher": "{% $class.teacher %}"
    },
    "values": [ 1, "{% $two %}", "three" ]
  },
  "Output": "{% { 'avg': $average($student.course.grade), 'num': $count($student.course) }  %}",
  "Next": "Process the result"
}

```

In this case, the "Arguments" field specifies a JSON object that
contains JSONata strings for some of its fields and array items,
and the "Output" field specifies a single JSONata string to create
the entire value. In other words, JSONata can be used to calculate
the entire value of a field, or individual parts of it.

The interpreter will first evaluate the JSONata expressions inside the
"Arguments" object including field values and array items, and send
the resulting object to the DoTheTask function:

```
{
  "student": "Scotland",
  "classInfo": {
    "teacher": "Bert"
  },
  "values": [ 1, "the number 2", "three" ]
}

```

After DoTheTask returns, the interpreter will evaluate the "Output"
field and return this JSON object:

```
{
  "avg": 76.25,
  "num": 4
}

```

### JSONata Runtime Errors

A JSONata expression can fail for different reasons. For example:

A JSONata expression may cause a type error, for example `"{% $x + $y %}"` if `$x` or `$y` is not a number.

A JSONata expression may evaluate to a type the field will not
accept, for example `"TimeoutSeconds": "{% $name %}"` in a Task State if `$name` is a
string, because TimeoutSeconds requires a number.

A JSONata expression may evaluate to a value the field will not
accept, for example `"ToleratedFailurePercentage": "{% $negative %}"` if
`$negative` evaluates to a negative number, because
ToleratedFailurePercentage requires a number between zero and 100.

A JSONata expression may fail to return a result, for example `"{% $data.thisFieldDoesNotExist %}"`, which is an error because JSON
cannot represent an undefined value.

In each case, the interpreter will throw
"States.QueryEvaluationError". Task, Map, and Parallel states MAY use
a Retrier to retry on the error, and a Catcher to catch
the error. See [Error Handling](https://states-language.net/#error-handling) for details.

### JSONata Restrictions

The States Language places some restrictions on JSONata expressions.

Unrestricted JSONata expressions can reference an implicitly-supplied
"input document" using unqualified field names and two built-in
variables called "$" and "$$". The States Language does not
implicitly provide an input document, so JSONata expressions cannot
use "$", "$$", or unqualified field names to reference it. Instead, a
JSONata expression MUST reference data through state machine variables.

The variable "$" or an unqualified field name at the top level of a
JSONata expression, for example `$`,`$.total`, or `total`, refers to the
input document, but "$" or an unqualified field name nested inside an
expression, for example `$order[$.total > 10]` or `$order[total > 10]`,
refers to the contextual value at that point in the evaluation. In
the States Language, a JSONata expression MUST NOT reference "$" or
unqualified field names at the top level, but MAY reference "$" or
unqualified field names nested inside an expression.

Since the variable "$$" always refers to the entire input document, a
JSONata expression MUST NOT reference "$$".

## JSONPath Concepts

When a state sets the query language to JSONPath, the interpreter
supports fields and syntax for querying data using JSONPath paths.
For information about JSONata, see
[JSONata Concepts](https://states-language.net/#jsonata-concepts).

### Paths

A Path is a string, beginning with "$", used to identify components
within a JSON text. The syntax is that of
[JSONPath](https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath "JSONPath").

When a Path begins with "$$", two dollar signs, this signals that it
is intended to identify content within the Context Object. The first
dollar sign is stripped, and the remaining text, which begins with a
dollar sign, is interpreted as the JSONPath applying to the Context
Object.

### Reference Paths

A Reference Path is a Path with syntax limited in such a way that it can
only identify a single node in a JSON structure: the operators "@", ",",
":", and "?" are not supported - all Reference Paths MUST be unambiguous
references to a single value, array, or object (subtree).

For example, if state input data contained the values:

```
{
  "foo": 123,
  "bar": ["a", "b", "c"],
  "car": {
      "cdr": true
  }
}

```

Then the following Reference Paths would return:

```
$.foo => 123
$.bar => ["a", "b", "c"]
$.car.cdr => true

```

Paths and Reference Paths are used by certain states, as specified later
in this document, to control the flow of a state machine or to configure
a state's settings or options.

Here are some examples of acceptable Reference Path syntax:

```
$.store.book
$.store\.book
$.\stor\e.boo\k
$.store.book.title
$.foo.\.bar
$.foo\@bar.baz\[\[.\?pretty
$.&Ж中.\uD800\uDF46
$.ledgers.branch[0].pending.count
$.ledgers.branch[0]
$.ledgers[0][22][315].foo
$['store']['book']
$['store'][0]['book']

```

### Payload Template

The interpreter dispatches data as input to tasks to do
useful work, and receives output back from them. A common requirement
is to reshape input data to meet the format expectations of tasks,
and similarly to reshape the output coming back. A JSON object structure
called a Payload Template is provided for this purpose.

In the Task, Map, Parallel, and Pass States, the Payload Template is the
value of a field named "Parameters". In the Task, Map, and Parallel
States, there is another Payload Template which is the value of a field
named "ResultSelector".

A Payload Template MUST be a JSON object; it has no required fields. The
interpreter processes the Payload Template as described in this section;
the result of that processing is called the payload.

To illustrate by example, the Task State has a field named "Parameters"
whose value is a Payload Template. Consider the following Task State:

```
"X": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:task:X",
  "Next": "Y",
  "Parameters": {
    "first": 88,
    "second": 99
  }
}

```

In this case, the payload is the object with "first" and "second" fields
whose values are respectively 88 and 99. No processing needs to be
performed and the payload is identical to the Payload Template.

Values from the Payload Template’s input and the Context Object can be
inserted into the payload with a combination of a field-naming
convention, Paths and Intrinsic Functions.

If any field within the Payload Template (however deeply nested) has a
name ending with the characters ".$", its value is transformed
according to the following rules and the field is renamed to strip the ".$"
suffix.

If the field value begins with only one "$", the value MUST be a Path.
In this case, the Path is applied to the Payload Template’s input and is
the new field value.

If the field value begins with "$$", the first dollar sign is stripped
and the remainder MUST be a Path. In this case, the Path is applied to
the Context Object and is the new field value.

If the field value does not begin with "$", it MUST be an Intrinsic
Function ([see Intrinsic Functions](https://states-language.net/#intrinsic-functions)). The interpreter invokes the Intrinsic Function and
the result is the new field value.

If the path is legal but cannot be applied successfully, the interpreter
fails the machine execution with an Error Name of
"States.ParameterPathFailure". If the Intrinsic Function fails during
evaluation, the interpreter fails the machine execution with an Error
Name of "States.IntrinsicFailure".

A JSON object MUST NOT have duplicate field names after fields ending
with the characters ".$" are renamed to strip the ".$" suffix.

```
"X": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:task:X",
  "Next": "Y",
  "Parameters": {
    "flagged": true,
    "parts": {
      "first.$": "$.vals[0]",
      "last3.$": "$.vals[-3:]"
    },
    "weekday.$": "$$.DayOfWeek",
    "formattedOutput.$": "States.Format('Today is {}', $$.DayOfWeek)"
  }
}

```

Suppose that the input to the P is as follows:

```
{
  "flagged": 7,
  "vals": [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
}

```

Further, suppose that the Context Object is as follows:

```
{
  "DayOfWeek": "TUESDAY"
}

```

In this case, the effective input to the code identified in the
"Resource" field would be as follows:

```
{
  "flagged": true,
  "parts": {
    "first": 0,
    "last3": [30, 40, 50]
  },
  "weekday": "TUESDAY",
  "formattedOutput": "Today is TUESDAY"
}

```

### Intrinsic Functions

The States Language provides a small number of "Intrinsic Functions", constructs
which look like functions in programming languages and can be used to help
Payload Templates process the data going to and from Task Resources. See
[Appendix B](https://states-language.net/#appendix-b) for a full list of
Intrinsic Functions

Here is an example of an Intrinsic Function named "States.Format"
being used to prepare data:

```
"X": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:task:X",
  "Next": "Y",
  "Parameters": {
    "greeting.$": "States.Format('Welcome to {} {}\\'s playlist.', $.firstName, $.lastName)"
  }
}

```

1. An Intrinsic Function MUST be a string.
2. The Intrinsic Function MUST begin with an Intrinsic Function name.
   An Intrinsic Function name MUST contain only the characters A
   through Z, a through z, 0 through 9, ".", and "\_".

   All Intrinsic Functions defined by this specification have names
   that begin with "States.". The interpreter MAY define its
   own Intrinsic Functions whose names MUST NOT begin with "States.".
3. The Intrinsic Function name MUST be followed immediately by a list
   of zero or more arguments, enclosed by "(" and ")", and separated by
   commas.
4. Intrinsic Function arguments may be strings enclosed by apostrophe
   (`'`) characters, numbers, null, Paths, or nested Intrinsic
   Functions.
5. The value of a string, number or null argument is the argument
   itself. The value of an argument which is a Path is the result of
   applying it to the input of the Payload Template. The value of an
   argument which is an Intrinsic Function is the result of the
   function invocation."

   Note that in the previous example, the first argument of
   `States.Format` could have been a Path that yielded the formatting
   template string.
6. The following characters are reserved for all Intrinsic Functions
   and MUST be escaped: ' { } \

   If any of the reserved characters needs to appear as part of the
   value without serving as a reserved character, it MUST be escaped
   with a backslash.

   If the character "\ needs to appear as part of the value without
   serving as an escape character, it MUST be escaped with a backslash.

   The literal string `\'` represents `'`.
   The literal string `\{` represents `{`.
   The literal string `\}` represents `}`.
   The literal string `\\` represents `\`.

   In JSON, all backslashes contained in a string literal value must be
   escaped with another backslash, therefore, the preceding sequences will equate to:

   The escaped string `\\'` represents `'`.
   The escaped string `\\{` represents `{`.
   The escaped string `\\}` represents `}`.
   The escaped string `\\\\` represents `\`.

   If an open escape backslash `\` is found in the Intrinsic Function,
   the interpreter will throw a runtime error.

### Reserved "states" Variable with JSONPath

The States Language reserves one variable called "states". When the
query language is JSONPath, its value is defined by the interpreter.
This version of the States Language specification does not specify any
contents of the "states" variable when the query language is JSONPath.
A state MUST NOT assign a value to "states".

### Input and Output Processing with JSONPath

As described earlier, data is passed between states as JSON texts.
However, a state may need to process only a subset of its input data,
may need to include a portion of one or more variable values,
and may need that data structured differently from the way it appears
in the input or variables. Similarly, it may need to control the
format and content of the data that it passes on as output or that it
assigns to variables.

Fields named "InputPath", "Parameters", "ResultSelector", "ResultPath",
and "OutputPath" exist to support this.

Any state except for Succeed and Fail MAY have "InputPath"
and "OutputPath".

States which potentially generate results MAY have "Parameters",
"ResultSelector" and "ResultPath": Task State, Parallel State, and Map
State.

Pass State MAY have "Parameters" and "ResultPath" to control its output
value.

#### Using InputPath, Parameters, ResultSelector, ResultPath and OutputPath

In this discussion, "raw input" means the JSON text that is the input to
a state. "Result" means the JSON text that a state generates, for
example from external code invoked by a Task State, the combined result
of the branches in a Parallel or Map State, or the Value of the "Result"
field in a Pass State. "Effective input" means the input after the
application of InputPath and Parameters, "effective result" means the
result after processing it with ResultSelector and "effective output"
means the final state output after processing the result with
ResultSelector, ResultPath and OutputPath.

1. The value of "InputPath" MUST be a Path, which is applied to a
   State’s raw input to select some or all of it; that selection is
   used by the state, for example in passing to Resources in Task
   States and Choices selectors in Choice States.
2. The value of "Parameters" MUST be a Payload Template which is a JSON
   object, whose input is the result of applying the InputPath to the
   raw input. If the "Parameters" field is provided, its payload, after
   the extraction and embedding, becomes the effective input.
3. The value of "ResultSelector" MUST be a Payload Template, whose
   input is the result, and whose payload replaces and becomes the
   effective result.
4. The value of "ResultPath" MUST be a Reference Path, which specifies
   the raw input’s combination with or replacement by the state’s
   result.

   The value of "ResultPath" MUST NOT begin with "$$"; i.e. it may
   not be used to insert content into the Context Object.
5. The value of "OutputPath" MUST be a Path, which is applied to the
   state’s output after the application of ResultPath, producing the
   effective output which serves as the raw input for the next state.

Note that JSONPath can yield multiple values when applied to an input
JSON text. For example, given the text:

```
{ "a": [1, 2, 3, 4] }

```

Then if the JSONPath `$.a[0,1]` is applied, the result will be two JSON
texts, `1` and `2`. When this happens, to produce the effective input,
the interpreter gathers the texts into an array, so in this example the
state would see the input:

```
[ 1, 2 ]

```

The same rule applies to OutputPath processing; if the OutputPath result
contains multiple values, the effective output is a JSON array
containing all of them.

The "ResultPath" field’s value is a Reference Path that specifies where
to place the result, relative to the raw input. If the raw input has a
field at the location addressed by the ResultPath value then in the
output that field is discarded and overwritten by the state's result.
Otherwise, a new field is created in the state output, with intervening
fields constructed as necessary. For example, given the raw input:

```
{
  "master": {
    "detail": [1, 2, 3]
  }
}

```

If the state's result is the number `6`, and the "ResultPath" is
`$.master.detail`, then in the output the `detail` field would be
overwritten:

```
{
  "master": {
    "detail": 6
  }
}

```

If instead a "ResultPath" of `$.master.result.sum` was used then the
result would be combined with the raw input, producing a chain of new
fields containing `result` and `sum`:

```
{
  "master": {
    "detail": [1, 2, 3],
    "result": {
      "sum": 6
    }
  }
}

```

If the value of InputPath is `null`, that means that the raw input is
discarded, and the effective input for the state is an empty JSON
object, `{}`. Note that having a value of `null` is different from the
"InputPath" field being absent.

If the value of ResultPath is `null`, that means that the state’s result
is discarded and its raw input becomes its result.

If the value of OutputPath is `null`, that means the input and result
are discarded, and the effective output from the state is an empty JSON
object, `{}`.

#### Using Assign

The value of "$" in "Assign" depends on the state type. In Task, Map,
and Parallel States, "$" refers to the result in a state's top-level "Assign",
and to the Error Output in a Catcher's "Assign".
In Choice and Wait States, "$" refers to the effective
input, which is the value after "InputPath" has been applied to the
state input. For Pass State, "$" refers to the result, whether
generated by the "Result" field or the "InputPath" and "Parameters"
fields.

#### Defaults

Each of InputPath, Parameters, ResultSelector, ResultPath, and
OutputPath are optional. The default value of InputPath is "$", so by
default the effective input is just the raw input. The default value of
ResultPath is "$", so by default a state’s result overwrites and
replaces the input. The default value of OutputPath is "$", so by
default a state’s effective output is the result of processing
ResultPath.

Parameters and ResultSelector have no default value. If absent, they
have no effect on their input.

Therefore, if none of InputPath, Parameters, ResultSelector, ResultPath,
or OutputPath are supplied, a state consumes the raw input as provided
and passes its result to the next state.

#### Input/Output Processing Examples

Consider the previous example of a Lambda task that sums a pair of
numbers. As presented, its input is: `{ "val1": 3, "val2": 4 }` and its
output is: `7`.

Suppose the input is little more complex:

```
{
  "title": "Numbers to add",
  "numbers": { "val1": 3, "val2": 4 }
}

```

Then suppose we modify the state definition by adding:

```
"InputPath": "$.numbers",
"ResultPath": "$.sum"

```

And finally, suppose we simplify Line 4 of the Lambda function to read as
follows: `return JSON.stringify(total)`. This is probably a better form
of the function, which should really only care about doing math and not
care how its result is labeled.

In this case, the output would be:

```
{
  "title": "Numbers to add",
  "numbers": { "val1": 3, "val2": 4 },
  "sum": 7
}

```

The interpreter might need to construct multiple levels of JSON object
to achieve the desired effect. Suppose the input to some Task State is:

```
{ "a": 1 }

```

Suppose the output from the Task is "Hi!", and the value of the
"ResultPath" field is "$.b.greeting". Then the output from the state
would be:

```
{
  "a": 1,
  "b": {
    "greeting": "Hi!"
  }
}

```

#### JSONPath Runtime Errors

Suppose a state’s input is the string `"foo"`, and its "ResultPath"
field has the value "$.x". Then ResultPath cannot apply and the
interpreter fails the machine with an Error Name of
"States.ResultPathMatchFailure".

## Error Handling

### Errors

Any state can encounter runtime errors. Errors can arise because of
state machine definition issues (e.g. JSONata evaluation errors
discussed in the
[JSONata Runtime Errors section](https://states-language.net/#jsonata-runtime-errors), or the
errors discussed in the
[JSONPath Runtime Errors section](https://states-language.net/#jsonpath-runtime-errors)), task
failures (e.g. an exception thrown by a Lambda function) or because of
transient issues, such as network partition events.

When a state reports an error, the default course of action for the
interpreter is to fail the whole state machine.

#### Error representation

Errors are identified by case-sensitive strings, called Error Names. The
States Language defines a set of built-in strings naming well-known
errors, all of which begin with the prefix "States."; see [Appendix A](https://states-language.net/#appendix-a).

States MAY report errors with other names, which MUST NOT begin with the
prefix "States.".

### Retrying after error

Task States, Parallel States, and Map States MAY have a field named
"Retry", whose value MUST be an array of objects, called Retriers.

Each Retrier MUST contain a field named "ErrorEquals" whose value MUST
be a non-empty array of Strings, which match [Error
Names](https://states-language.net/#error-names).

When a state reports an error, the interpreter scans through the
Retriers and, when the Error Name appears in the value of a Retrier’s
"ErrorEquals" field, implements the retry policy described in that
Retrier.

An individual Retrier represents a certain number of retries, usually at
increasing time intervals.

A Retrier MAY contain a field named "IntervalSeconds", whose value MUST
be a positive integer, representing the number of seconds before the
first retry attempt (default value: 1); a field named "MaxAttempts"
whose value MUST be a non-negative integer, representing the maximum
number of retry attempts (default: 3); a field named "MaxDelaySeconds"
whose value MUST be positive integer, representing the maximum interval
in seconds to wait before the next retry attempt; a field named
"JitterStrategy", whose value MUST be a string, representing the jitter
strategy to use in the retry interval calculation; and a field named
"BackoffRate", a number which is the multiplier that increases the retry
interval on each attempt (default: 2.0). The value of BackoffRate MUST
be greater than or equal to 1.0.

Note that a "MaxAttempts" field whose value is 0 is legal, specifying
that some error or errors should never be retried.

The States Language does not constrain the value of the "JitterStrategy"
field. The interpreter will use the specified value to select the jitter
strategy to use when calculating the retry interval.

Here is an example of a Retrier which will make 2 retry attempts after
waits of 3 and 6 seconds:

```
"Retry" : [
  {
    "ErrorEquals": [ "States.Timeout" ],
    "IntervalSeconds": 3,
    "MaxAttempts": 2,
    "BackoffRate": 2.0
  }
]

```

Here is the same example, but with a maximum limit of 4 seconds on the
retry interval. In this case the Retrier will make the second attempt
after 4 seconds, rather than 6 seconds:

```
"Retry" : [
  {
    "ErrorEquals": [ "States.Timeout" ],
    "IntervalSeconds": 3,
    "MaxAttempts": 2,
    "BackoffRate": 2.0,
    "MaxDelaySeconds": 4
  }
]

```

Here is an example of a Retrier which uses an interpreter-defined
JitterStrategy called "SAMPLE". Instead of waiting for 2 seconds before
the first retry attempt or 4 seconds before the second retry attempt,
the interpreter will modify these values according to the jitter
strategy:

```
"Retry" : [
  {
    "ErrorEquals": [ "States.Timeout" ],
    "IntervalSeconds": 2,
    "MaxAttempts": 2,
    "BackoffRate": 2.0,
    "JitterStrategy": "SAMPLE"
  }
]

```

The reserved name "States.ALL" in a Retrier’s "ErrorEquals" field is a
wildcard and matches any Error Name. Such a value MUST appear alone in
the "ErrorEquals" array and MUST appear in the last Retrier in the
"Retry" array.

Here is an example of a Retrier which will retry any error except for
"States.Timeout", using the default retry parameters.

```
"Retry" : [
  {
    "ErrorEquals": [ "States.Timeout" ],
    "MaxAttempts": 0
  },
  {
    "ErrorEquals": [ "States.ALL" ]
  }
]

```

If the error recurs more times than allowed for by the "MaxAttempts"
field, retries cease and normal error handling resumes.

#### Complex retry scenarios

A Retrier’s parameters apply across all visits to that Retrier in the
context of a single state execution. This is best illustrated by
example; consider the following Task State:

```
"X": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:task:X",
  "Next": "Y",
  "Retry": [
    {
      "ErrorEquals": [ "ErrorA", "ErrorB" ],
      "IntervalSeconds": 1,
      "BackoffRate": 2,
      "MaxAttempts": 2
    },
    {
      "ErrorEquals": [ "ErrorC" ],
      "IntervalSeconds": 5
    }
  ],
  "Catch": [
    {
      "ErrorEquals": [ "States.ALL" ],
      "Next": "Z"
    }
  ]
}

```

Suppose that this task fails four successive times, throwing Error Names
"ErrorA", "ErrorB", "ErrorC", and "ErrorB". The first two errors match
the first retrier and cause waits of one and two seconds. The third
error matches the second retrier and causes a wait of five seconds. The
fourth error would match the first retrier but its "MaxAttempts" ceiling
of two retries has already been reached, so that Retrier fails, and
execution is redirected to the "Z" state via the "Catch" field.

Note that once the interpreter transitions to another state in any way,
all the Retrier parameters reset.

### Fallback states

Task States, Parallel States, and Map States MAY have a field named
"Catch", whose value MUST be an array of objects, called Catchers.

Each Catcher MUST contain a field named "ErrorEquals", specified exactly
as with the Retrier "ErrorEquals" field, and a field named "Next" whose
value MUST be a string exactly matching a State Name.

When a state reports an error and either there is no Retrier, or retries have
failed to resolve the error, the interpreter scans through the Catchers in array
order, and when the [Error Name](https://states-language.net/#error-names) appears in the value of
a Catcher’s "ErrorEquals" field, transitions the machine to the state named in
the value of the "Next" field.

The reserved name "States.ALL" appearing in a Catcher’s "ErrorEquals"
field is a wildcard and matches any Error Name. Such a value MUST appear
alone in the "ErrorEquals" array and MUST appear in the last Catcher in
the "Catch" array.

Each Catcher can list multiple errors to handle.

When a state has both "Retry" and "Catch" fields, the interpreter uses
any appropriate Retriers first and only applies the matching Catcher
transition if the retry policy fails to resolve the error.

#### Error output

When a state reports an error and it matches a Catcher, causing a
transfer to another state, the state’s result is a JSON object, called
the Error Output. The Error Output MUST have a string-valued field named
"Error", containing the Error Name. It SHOULD have a string-valued field
named "Cause", containing human-readable text about the error.

A Catcher MAY have an "Assign" field, which works exactly like
[a state's top-level "Assign"](https://states-language.net/#assigning-variables), and may be used
to assign values to one or more variables. If a state reports an
error, the interpreter evaluates the matching Catcher's "Assign"
field, if any, and does not evaluate the state's top-level "Assign"
field.

#### JSONata Catchers

In JSONata States, a Catcher MAY have an "Output" field, which works
exactly like [a state's top-level "Output"](https://states-language.net/#arguments-and-output),
and may be used to provide the state output, which will become the
input for the Catcher's "Next" state. If the "Output" field is not
provided, the
state output is the Error Output.

In JSONata States, a Catcher's "Assign" and "Output" fields MAY reference the
`$states.input`, `$states.errorOutput`, and `$states.context` fields.

Here is an example of a Catcher that will transition to the state named
"RecoveryState" when a Lambda function throws an unhandled Java
Exception, and otherwise to the "EndMachine" state, which is presumably
Terminal.

If the first Catcher matches the Error Name, the input to
"RecoveryState" will be the original state input, with the Error
Output as the value of the top-level "error-info" field. For any other
error, the variable `isCritical` will be assigned the value of a
JSONata expression, and the input to "EndMachine" will just be the
Error Output.

```
"Catch": [
  {
    "ErrorEquals": [ "java.lang.Exception" ],
    "Output": "{% $merge([ $states.input, {'error-info': $states.errorOutput} ]) %}",
    "Next": "RecoveryState"
  },
  {
    "ErrorEquals": [ "States.ALL" ],
    "Assign": {
      "isCritical": "{% $contains($lowercase($states.errorOutput.Error), /.*fatal.*/)  %}"
    },
    "Next": "EndMachine"
  }
]

```

#### JSONPath Catchers

In JSONPath States, a Catcher MAY have a "ResultPath" field, which works exactly like [a state’s
top-level "ResultPath"](https://states-language.net/#filters), and may be used to inject
the Error Output into the state’s original input to create the input for the
Catcher’s "Next" state. The default value, if the "ResultPath" field is not
provided, is "$", meaning that the output consists entirely of the Error
Output.

Here is an example of a Catcher that will transition to the state named
"RecoveryState" when a Lambda function throws an unhandled Java
Exception, and otherwise to the "EndMachine" state, which is presumably
Terminal.

If the first Catcher matches the Error Name, the
input to "RecoveryState" will be the original state input, with the
Error Output as the value of the top-level "error-info" field. For any
other error, the variable `hasError` will be assigned `true`, and the input
to "EndMachine" will just be the Error Output.

```
"Catch": [
  {
    "ErrorEquals": [ "java.lang.Exception" ],
    "ResultPath": "$.error-info",
    "Next": "RecoveryState"
  },
  {
    "ErrorEquals": [ "States.ALL" ],
    "Assign": {
      "hasError": true
    },
    "Next": "EndMachine"
  }
]

```

## State Types

As a reminder, the state type is given by the value of the "Type" field,
which MUST appear in every State object.

Many fields can appear in more than one state type. The following tables
summarize which common fields can appear in which states for JSONata States
and JSONPath States. It excludes fields that are specific to one
state type.

### Table of State Types and Fields (JSONata)

| ResultSelector | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed |  |  |  |  |  |
| Retry, Catch | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed |  |  |  |  |  |

### Pass State

The Pass State (identified by `"Type":"Pass"`) by default passes its
input to its output, performing no work.

A Pass State MAY have an "Assign" field to assign variables.

#### JSONata Pass State

A JSONata Pass State MAY have an "Output" field whose value, if
present, will become the state output. If "Output" is not provided,
the Pass State copies its input through to its output.

Here is an example of a Pass State that provides some fixed data in a
variable.

```
"ProvideTestData": {
  "Type": "Pass",
  "QueryLanguage": "JSONata",
  "Assign": {
    "coords": {
      "x-datum": 0.381018,
      "y-datum": 622.2269926397355,
      "additional": "{% $exists($states.input.moreData) ? $states.input.moreData : {} %}"
    }
  },
  "Next": "End"
}

```

#### JSONPath Pass State

A Pass State MAY have a field named "Result". If present, its value is
treated as the output of a virtual task, and placed as prescribed by the
"ResultPath" field, if any, to be passed on to the next state. If
"Result" is not provided, the output is the input. Thus, if neither
"Result" nor "ResultPath" are provided, the Pass State copies its input
through to its output.

Here is an example of a Pass State that injects some fixed data into the
state machine.

```
"ProvideTestData": {
  "Type": "Pass",
  "Result": {
    "x-datum": 0.381018,
    "y-datum": 622.2269926397355
  },
  "ResultPath": "$.coords",
  "Next": "End"
}

```

Suppose the input to this state were as follows:

```
{
  "georefOf": "Home"
}

```

Then the output would be:

```
{
  "georefOf": "Home",
  "coords": {
    "x-datum": 0.381018,
    "y-datum": 622.2269926397355
  }
}

```

### Task State

The Task State (identified by `"Type":"Task"`) causes the interpreter to
execute the work identified by the state’s "Resource" field.

Here is an example:

```
"TaskState": {
  "Comment": "Task State example",
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:task:HelloWorld",
  "Next": "NextState",
  "TimeoutSeconds": 300,
  "HeartbeatSeconds": 60
}

```

A Task State MUST include a "Resource" field, whose value MUST be a URI
that uniquely identifies the specific task to execute. The States
language does not constrain the URI scheme nor any other part of the
URI.

A JSONata Task State MAY have an "Arguments" field which, if present,
provides the input to the task it will execute. If "Arguments" is not
provided, the state input is passed as the input to the task.

A
JSONata Task State MAY have an "Output" field whose value, if present,
will become the state output. If "Output" is not provided, the Task
State copies its input through to its output.

A JSONPath Task State MAY have an "InputPath" field, whose value MUST
be a path, to filter the state input, and MAY have a "Parameters"
field, whose value MUST be a Payload Template which is used to
generate the effective input for the task in the usual way.

A JSONPath Task State MAY have a "ResultSelector" field, whose value
MUST be a Payload Template which is used to generate the effective
result, MAY have a "ResultPath" field which is used to insert the
effective result into the input data, and MAY have an "OutputPath"
field, whose value MUST be a path which is used to create the state
output in the usual way.

A Task State MAY have an "Assign" field to assign variables.

#### Timeouts

Tasks can optionally specify timeouts. Timeouts (the "TimeoutSeconds"
and "HeartbeatSeconds" fields) are specified in seconds and MUST be
positive integers.

Both the total and heartbeat timeouts can be provided indirectly.

A JSONata Task State MAY specify JSONata strings for the
"TimeoutSeconds" and "HeartbeatSeconds" fields whose values, when
evaluated, MUST be positive integers.

A JSONPath Task
State MAY have "TimeoutSecondsPath" and "HeartbeatSecondsPath" fields
which MUST be Reference Paths; when resolved, they MUST select fields
whose values are positive integers. A Task State MUST NOT include both
"TimeoutSeconds" and "TimeoutSecondsPath" or both "HeartbeatSeconds" and
"HeartbeatSecondsPath".

If provided, the "HeartbeatSeconds" interval MUST be smaller than the
"TimeoutSeconds" value.

If not provided, the default value of "TimeoutSeconds" is 60.

If the state executes longer than the specified timeout, or if more time
than the specified heartbeat elapses between heartbeats from the task,
then the interpreter fails the state with a `States.Timeout` Error Name.

#### Credentials

A Task State MAY include a "Credentials" field, whose value MUST be a
JSON object whose value is defined by the interpreter. The States
language does not constrain the value of the "Credentials" field. The
interpreter will use the specified credentials to execute the work
identified by the state's "Resource" field.

### Choice State

A Choice State (identified by `"Type":"Choice"`) adds branching logic to
a state machine.

A Choice State MUST have a "Choices" field whose value is a non-empty
array. Each element of the array MUST be a JSON object and is called a
Choice Rule. A Choice Rule may be evaluated to return a boolean value. A
Choice Rule at the top level, i.e. which is a member of the "Choices"
array, MUST have a "Next" field, whose value MUST match a state name.

Each Choice Rule MAY have an "Assign" field, which works exactly like
[a state's top-level "Assign"](https://states-language.net/#assigning-variables), and may be used
to assign values to one or more variables. If a Choice Rule is
chosen, the interpreter evaluates the Choice Rule's "Assign" field, if
any, and does not evaluate the state's top-level "Assign" field.

If no Choice Rules match, the interpreter evaluates the states's
top-level "Assign" field, if any.

Choice Rule comparison fields differ depending on the state's query
language.

#### JSONata Choice Rules

In a JSONata Choice State, each Choice Rule MUST have a "Condition"
field. The "Condition" field accepts a boolean value or a JSONata
string that must evaluate to a boolean value.

The interpreter scans the Choice Rules in order and chooses the
first Choice Rule whose "Condition" field evaluates to `true`. It
evaluates the chosen Choice Rule's "Assign" and "Output" fields, if
any, and then transitions to the state specified in the "Next" field.

Each Choice Rule MAY have an "Output" field, which works exactly like
[a state's top-level "Output"](https://states-language.net/#arguments-and-output). If a Choice
Rule is
chosen, the value of its "Output" field, if any, will become the state
output, which will become the input for the Choice Rule's
"Next" state. If an "Output" field is not provided, the state input
is passed through to its output.

If no Choice Rule is chosen, the value of the state's top-level
"Output" field, if any, will become the state output, which will
become the input for the next state as specified by the Choice State's
"Default" field. If an "Output" field is not provided, the state
input is passed through to its output.

The "Output" and "Assign" fields MAY reference the `$states.input` and
`$states.context` fields.

For example:

```
"DispatchEvent": {
  "Type" : "Choice",
  "QueryLanguage": "JSONata",
  "Choices": [
    {
      "Condition": "{% $states.input.type != 'Private' %}",
      "Next": "Public"
    },
    {
      "Condition": "{% $exists($value) and $type($value)='number' and $value>=20 and $value<30 %}",
      "Assign": {
        "range": "twenties"
      },
      "Next": "ValueInTwenties"
    },
    {
      "Condition": "{% $states.input.rating >= $states.input.auditThreshold %}",
      "Output": {
        "excess": "{% $states.input.rating - $states.input.auditThreshold %}"
      },
      "Next": "StartAudit"
    }
  ],
  "Default": "RecordEvent",
  "Assign": {
    "range": "default"
  }
}

```

If `$states.input.type` = `"Private"`, and `$value` is `23`, then the
second Choice Rule matches, the `range` variable will be assigned the
string `"twenties"`, and the state input will be passed through to its
output before transitioning to the "ValueInTwenties" state.

If the third Choice Rule matches, then the state output will be
assigned a JSON object with its `"excess"` field set to the difference
between the `rating` and `auditThreshold` fields in the state input,
and no variables will be assigned, before transitioning to the
"StartAudit" state.

If no Choice Rules match, the `range` variable will be assigned the
string `"default"`, and the state input will be passed through to its
output before transitioning to the "RecordEvent" state.

#### JSONPath Choice Rules

The interpreter attempts pattern-matches against the top-level Choice
Rules in order and transitions to the state specified in the
"Next" field on the first Choice Rule where there is an exact match
between the input value and a member of the comparison-operator array.

Here is an equivalent example of a JSONPath Choice State.

```
"DispatchEvent": {
  "Type" : "Choice",
  "Choices": [
    {
      "Not": {
        "Variable": "$.type",
        "StringEquals": "Private"
      },
      "Next": "Public"
    },
    {
      "And": [
        {
          "Variable": "$.value",
          "IsPresent": true
        },
        {
          "Variable": "$.value",
          "IsNumeric": true
        },
        {
          "Variable": "$.value",
          "NumericGreaterThanEquals": 20
        },
        {
          "Variable": "$.value",
          "NumericLessThan": 30
        }
      ],
      "Assign": {
        "range": "twenties"
      },
      "Next": "ValueInTwenties"
    },
    {
      "Variable": "$.rating",
      "NumericGreaterThanPath": "$.auditThreshold",
      "Next": "StartAudit"
    }
  ],
  "Default": "RecordEvent",
  "Assign": {
    "range": "default"
  }
}

```

In this example, suppose the machine is started with an input value of:

```
{
  "type": "Private",
  "value": 22
}

```

Then the interpreter will assign the string `"twenties"` to `range`
before transitioning to the "ValueInTwenties" state, based on the
"value" field.

A Choice Rule MUST be either a Boolean Expression or a Data-test
Expression.

#### Boolean expression for JSONPath Choice Rules

A Boolean Expression is a JSON object which contains a field named
"And", "Or", or "Not". If the field name is "And" or "Or", the value
MUST be a non-empty object array of Choice Rules, which MUST NOT
contain "Next" fields; the interpreter processes the array elements in
order, performing the boolean evaluations in the expected fashion,
ceasing array processing when the boolean value has been unambiguously
determined.

The value of a Boolean Expression containing a "Not" field MUST be a
single Choice Rule, that MUST NOT contain a "Next" field; it returns the
inverse of the boolean to which the Choice Rule evaluates.

#### Data-test expression for JSONPath Choice Rules

A Data-test Expression Choice Rule is an assertion about a field and its
value which yields a boolean depending on the data. A Data-test
Expression MUST contain a field named "Variable" whose value MUST be a
Path.

Each choice rule MUST contain exactly one field containing a comparison
operator. The following comparison operators are supported:

1. StringEquals, StringEqualsPath
2. StringLessThan, StringLessThanPath
3. StringGreaterThan, StringGreaterThanPath
4. StringLessThanEquals, StringLessThanEqualsPath
5. StringGreaterThanEquals, StringGreaterThanEqualsPath
6. StringMatches

   Note: The value MUST be a String which MAY contain one or more "\*"
   characters. The expression yields true if the data value selected by
   the Variable Path matches the value, where "\*" in the value matches
   zero or more characters. Thus, `foo*.log` matches `foo23.log`,
   `*.log` matches `zebra.log`, and `foo*.*` matches `foobar.zebra`. No
   characters other than "\*" have any special meaning during matching.

   If the character "\*" needs to appear as part of the value without
   serving as a wildcard, it MUST be escaped with a backslash.

   If the character "\ needs to appear as part of the value without
   serving as an escape character, it MUST be escaped with a backslash.

   The literal string `\*` represents `*`.
   The literal string `\\` represents `\`.

   In JSON, all backslashes contained in a string literal value must be
   escaped with another backslash, therefore, the preceding sequences will equate to:

   The escaped string `\\*` represents `*`.
   The escaped string `\\\\` represents `\`.

   If an open escape backslash `\` is found in the StringMatches
   string, the interpreter will throw a runtime error.
7. NumericEquals, NumericEqualsPath
8. NumericLessThan, NumericLessThanPath
9. NumericGreaterThan, NumericGreaterThanPath
10. NumericLessThanEquals, NumericLessThanEqualsPath
11. NumericGreaterThanEquals, NumericGreaterThanEqualsPath
12. BooleanEquals, BooleanEqualsPath
13. TimestampEquals, TimestampEqualsPath
14. TimestampLessThan, TimestampLessThanPath
15. TimestampGreaterThan, TimestampGreaterThanPath
16. TimestampLessThanEquals, TimestampLessThanEqualsPath
17. TimestampGreaterThanEquals, TimestampGreaterThanEqualsPath
18. IsNull

    Note: This means the value is the built-in JSON literal `null`.
19. IsPresent

    Note: In this case, if the Variable-field Path fails to match
    anything in the input no exception is thrown and the Choice Rule
    just returns false.
20. IsNumeric
21. IsString
22. IsBoolean
23. IsTimestamp

For those operators that end with "Path", the value MUST be a Path, to
be applied to the state’s effective input to yield a value to be
compared with the value yielded by the Variable path.

For each operator which compares values, if the values are not both of
the appropriate type (String, number, boolean, or
[Timestamp](https://states-language.net/#timestamps)) the comparison will return false. Note that a
field which is thought of as a timestamp could be matched by a
string-typed comparator.

The various String comparators compare strings character-by-character
with no special treatments such as case-folding, white-space collapsing,
or [Unicode form normalization](https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/ "Unicode Normalization Forms").

Note that for interoperability, numeric comparisons should not be
assumed to work with values outside the magnitude or precision
representable using the IEEE 754-2008 "binary64" data type. In
particular, integers outside of the range [-(253)+1,
(253)-1] might fail to compare in the expected way.

A Choice State MAY have a "Default" field, whose value MUST be a string
whose value MUST match a State name; that state will execute if none of
the Choice Rules match. The interpreter will throw a runtime
States.NoChoiceMatched error if a Choice State fails to match a Choice
Rule and no "Default" transition was specified.

A Choice State MUST NOT be an End state.

### Wait State

A Wait State (identified by `"Type":"Wait"`) causes the interpreter to
delay the machine from continuing for a specified time. The time can be
specified as a wait duration, specified in seconds, or an absolute
expiry time, which MUST conform to the
[RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt "RFC 3339") profile of ISO 8601,
with the further restrictions that an uppercase "T" character MUST be
used to separate date and time, and an uppercase "Z" character MUST be
present in the absence of a numeric time zone offset, for example
"2016-03-14T01:59:00Z".

A Wait State MAY have an "Assign" field to assign variables.

For example, the following Wait State introduces a ten-second delay into
a state machine:

```
"wait_ten_seconds" : {
  "Type" : "Wait",
  "Seconds" : 10,
  "Next": "NextState"
}

```

This waits until an absolute time:

```
"wait_until" : {
  "Type": "Wait",
  "Timestamp": "2016-03-14T01:59:00Z",
  "Next": "NextState"
}

```

Both the seconds and timestamp can be provided indirectly.

#### JSONata Wait State

A JSONata Wait State MAY specify a JSONata string for the
"Seconds" field whose value, when evaluated, MUST be a non-negative
integer. It MAY specify a JSONata string for the "Timestamp"
field whose value, when evaluated, MUST be a string containing a valid
timestamp.

This example uses a JSONata expression to look up the timestamp from
data that might look like `{ "expirydate": "2016-03-14T01:59:00Z" }`:

```
"wait_until" : {
  "Type": "Wait",
  "QueryLanguage": "JSONata",
  "Timestamp": "{% $states.input.expirydate %}",
  "Next": "NextState"
}

```

A JSONata Wait State MAY have an "Output" field whose value, if
present, will become the state output. If "Output" is not provided,
the Wait State copies its input through to its output.

A JSONata Wait State MUST contain exactly one of "Seconds" or
"Timestamp".

#### JSONPath Wait State

A JSONPath Wait State MAY have a "SecondsPath" field which MUST be a
Reference Path which, when resolved, MUST select a field whose value
is a non-negative integer. It MAY have a "TimestampPath" field which MUST
be a Reference Path which, when resolved, MUST select a field whose
value is a valid timestamp.

This example uses a Reference Path to look up the timestamp
from data that might look like `{ "expirydate": "2016-03-14T01:59:00Z" }`:

```
"wait_until" : {
  "Type": "Wait",
  "TimestampPath": "$.expirydate",
  "Next": "NextState"
}

```

A JSONPath Wait State MUST contain exactly one of "Seconds", "SecondsPath",
"Timestamp", or "TimestampPath".

### Succeed State

The Succeed State (identified by `"Type": "Succeed"`) either terminates a
state machine successfully, ends a branch of a Parallel State, or ends
an iteration of a Map State.

The Succeed State is a useful target for Choice-State branches that
do not do anything except terminate the machine.

A JSONata Succeed State MAY have an "Output" field whose value, if
present, will become the state output. If "Output" is not provided,
the Succeed State copies its input through to its output.

The output of a JSONPath Succeed State is the same as its input,
possibly modified by "InputPath" and/or "OutputPath".

Here is an example:

```
"SuccessState": {
  "Type": "Succeed"
}

```

Because Succeed States are terminal states, they have no "Next" field.

### Fail State

The Fail State (identified by `"Type": "Fail"`) terminates the machine
and marks it as a failure.

Here is an example:

```
"FailState": {
  "Type": "Fail",
  "Error": "ErrorA",
  "Cause": "Kaiju attack"
}

```

A Fail State MAY have a field named "Error", whose value MUST be a
string whose value provides an error name that can be used for error
handling (Retry/Catch), operational, or diagnostic purposes. A Fail
State MAY have a field named "Cause", whose value MUST be a string whose
value provides a human-readable message.

Because Fail States are terminal states, they have no "Next" field.

Both the "Error" and "Cause" can be provided indirectly.

#### JSONata Fail State

A JSONata Fail State MAY specify JSONata strings for the "Error"
and "Cause" fields whose values, when evaluated, MUST be string
values.

Here is an example that sets the Error and Cause values dynamically from
the state input rather than using static values:

```
"FailState": {
  "Type": "Fail",
  "QueryLanguage": "JSONata",
  "Comment": "my error comment",
  "Error": "{% $states.input.Error %}",
  "Cause": "{% $states.input.Cause %}"
}

```

#### JSONPath Fail State

A JSONPath Fail state
MAY have "ErrorPath" and "CausePath" fields whose values MUST be
Reference Paths or Intrinsic Functions which, when resolved, MUST be
string values. A Fail state MUST NOT include both "Error" and
"ErrorPath" or both "Cause" and "CausePath".

Here is an example that sets the Error and Cause values dynamically from
the state input rather than using static values:

```
"FailState": {
  "Type": "Fail",
  "Comment": "my error comment",
  "ErrorPath": "$.Error",
  "CausePath": "$.Cause"
}

```

### Parallel State

The Parallel State (identified by `"Type": "Parallel"`) causes parallel
execution of "branches".

Here is an example:

```
"LookupCustomerInfo": {
  "Type": "Parallel",
  "Branches": [
    {
      "StartAt": "LookupAddress",
      "States": {
        "LookupAddress": {
          "Type": "Task",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:AddressFinder",
          "End": true
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "StartAt": "LookupPhone",
      "States": {
        "LookupPhone": {
          "Type": "Task",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:PhoneFinder",
          "End": true
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "Next": "NextState"
}

```

A Parallel State causes the interpreter to execute each branch starting
with the state named in its "StartAt" field, as concurrently as
possible, and wait until each branch terminates (reaches a terminal
state) before processing the Parallel State's "Next" field. In the previous
example, this means the interpreter waits for "LookupAddress" and
"LookupPhoneNumber" to both finish before transitioning to "NextState".

In the previous example, the LookupAddress and LookupPhoneNumber branches
are executed in parallel.

A Parallel State MUST contain a field named "Branches" which is an array
whose elements MUST be objects. Each object MUST contain fields named
"States" and "StartAt" whose meanings are exactly like those in the top
level of a State Machine.

A state in a Parallel State branch "States" field MUST NOT have a "Next"
field that targets a field outside of that "States" field. A state MUST
NOT have a "Next" field which matches a state name inside a Parallel
State branch’s "States" field unless it is also inside the same "States"
field.

Put another way, states in a branch’s "States" field can transition only
to each other, and no state outside of that "States" field can
transition into it.

If any branch fails, due to an unhandled error or by transitioning to a
Fail State, the entire Parallel State is considered to have failed and
all the branches are terminated. If the error is not handled by the
Parallel State, the interpreter should terminate the machine execution
with an error.

Unlike a Fail State, a Succeed State within a Parallel merely terminates
its own branch. A Succeed State passes its input through as its output,
possibly modified by "Output" for JSONata, or "InputPath" and "OutputPath"
for JSONPath.

A JSONata Parallel State MAY have an "Arguments" field which, if
present, provides the input for each branch's "StartAt" state. If
"Arguments" is not provided, the state input is passed as the input to
each branch's "StartAt" state.

A JSONPath Parallel State MAY have an "InputPath" field, whose value
MUST be a path, to filter the state input, and MAY have a "Parameters"
field, whose value MUST be a Payload Template which is used to
generate the effective input to each branch's "StartAt" state.

The Parallel State generates a result which is an array with one element for each branch
containing the output from that branch. The elements of the output array
correspond to the branches in the same order that they appear in the
"Branches" array. There is no requirement that all elements be of the
same type.

A JSONata Parallel State MAY have an "Output" field whose value, if
present, will become the state output. If "Output" is not provided,
the state output is the result, meaning the output array containing
the branch outputs.

A JSONPath Parallel State MAY have a "ResultSelector" field, whose
value MUST be a Payload Template which is used to generate the
effective result, MAY have a "ResultPath" field which is used to
insert the effective result into the input data, and MAY have an
"OutputPath" field, whose value MUST be a path which is used to create
the state output in the usual way.

For example, consider the following Parallel State:

```
"FunWithMath": {
  "Type": "Parallel",
  "Branches": [
    {
      "StartAt": "Add",
      "States": {
        "Add": {
          "Type": "Task",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::task:Add",
          "End": true
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "StartAt": "Subtract",
      "States": {
        "Subtract": {
          "Type": "Task",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::task:Subtract",
          "End": true
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "Next": "NextState"
}

```

If the "FunWithMath" state was given the JSON array `[3, 2]` as input,
then both the "Add" and "Subtract" states would receive that array as
input. The output of "Add" would be `5`, that of "Subtract" would be
`1`, and the output of the Parallel State would be a JSON array:

```
[ 5, 1 ]

```

### Map State

The Map State (identified by `"Type": "Map"`) causes the interpreter to
process all the elements of an array, potentially in parallel, with the
processing of each element independent of the others. This document uses
the term "iteration" to describe each such nested execution.

The Parallel State applies multiple different state-machine branches to
the same input, while the Map State applies a single state machine to
multiple input elements.

There are several fields which may be used to control the execution. To
summarize:

1. The "ItemProcessor" (or deprecated "Iterator") field's
   value is an object that defines a state machine which will process
   each item or batch of items of the array.
2. For JSONata, the "Items" field's value is a JSON array or a
   JSONata string that MUST produce a JSON array. For JSONPath,
   the "ItemsPath" field's value is a Reference Path identifying
   where in the effective input the array field is found. The
   selected array is called the Items Array.
3. The "ItemReader" field's value is an object that specifies where to
   read the items instead of from the effective input.
4. The "ItemSelector" (or deprecated JSONPath "Parameters") field's value is
   an object that overrides each single element of the Items Array.
5. The "ItemBatcher" field's value is an object that specifies how to
   batch the items for the ItemProcessor.
6. The "ResultWriter" field's value is an object that specifies where
   to write the results instead of to the Map state's result.
7. The "MaxConcurrency" field's value is an integer that provides an
   upper bound on how many invocations of the Iterator may execute in
   parallel.
8. The "ToleratedFailurePercentage" field's value is an integer that
   provides an upper bound on the percentage of items that may fail.
9. The "ToleratedFailureCount" field's value is an integer that
   provides an upper bound on how many items may fail.

The Map State generates a result as described in
[Writing Results](https://states-language.net/#writing-results).

A JSONata Map State MAY have an "Output" field whose value, if
present, will become the state output. If "Output" is not provided,
the state output is the result.

A JSONPath Map State MAY have a "ResultSelector" field, whose
value MUST be a Payload Template which is used to generate the
effective result, MAY have a "ResultPath" field which is used to
insert the effective result into the input data, and MAY have an
"OutputPath" field, whose value MUST be a path which is used to create
the state output in the usual way.

Consider the following example input data:

```
{
  "ship-date": "2016-03-14T01:59:00Z",
  "detail": {
    "delivery-partner": "UQS",
    "shipped": [
      { "prod": "R31", "dest-code": 9511, "quantity": 1344 },
      { "prod": "S39", "dest-code": 9511, "quantity": 40 },
      { "prod": "R31", "dest-code": 9833, "quantity": 12 },
      { "prod": "R40", "dest-code": 9860, "quantity": 887 },
      { "prod": "R40", "dest-code": 9511, "quantity": 1220 }
    ]
  }
}

```

Suppose it is desired to apply a single Lambda function, "ship-val", to
each of the elements of the "shipped" array. Here is an example of an
appropriate Map State.

#### JSONata Map State

```
"Validate-All": {
  "Type": "Map",
  "QueryLanguage": "JSONata",
  "Items": "{% $states.input.detail.shipped %}",
  "MaxConcurrency": 0,
  "ItemProcessor": {
    "StartAt": "Validate",
    "States": {
      "Validate": {
        "Type": "Task",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:ship-val",
        "End": true
      }
    }
  },
  "Assign": {
    "shipped": "{% $states.result %}"
  },
  "Output": {
    "numItemsProcessed": "{% $count($states.input.detail.shipped) %}"
  },
  "End": true
}

```

In the previous example, the "ship-val" Lambda function will be executed
once for each element of the "shipped" field. The input to one iteration
will be:

```
{
  "prod": "R31",
  "dest-code": 9511,
  "quantity": 1344
}

```

Suppose that the "ship-val" function also needs access to the shipment’s
courier, which would be the same in each iteration. The "ItemSelector"
field may be used to construct the raw input for each iteration:

```
"Validate-All": {
  "Type": "Map",
  "QueryLanguage": "JSONata",
  "Items": "{% $states.input.detail.shipped %}",
  "MaxConcurrency": 0,
  "ItemSelector": {
    "parcel": "{% $states.context.Map.Item.Value %}",
    "courier": "{% $states.input.delivery-partner %}"
  },
  "ItemProcessor": {
    "StartAt": "Validate",
    "States": {
      "Validate": {
        "Type": "Task",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:ship-val",
        "End": true
      }
    }
  },
  "Assign": {
    "shipped": "{% $states.result %}"
  },
  "Output": {
    "numItemsProcessed": "{% $count($states.input.detail.shipped) %}"
  },
  "End": true
}

```

The "ship-val" Lambda function will be executed once for each element of
the array selected by "Items". In the previous example, the raw input
to one iteration, as specified by "ItemSelector", will be:

```
{
  "parcel": {
    "prod": "R31",
    "dest-code": 9511,
    "quantity": 1344
   },
   "courier": "UQS"
}

```

In the previous examples, the "Assign" field assigns the result to
variable `shipped`, and the "Output" field assigns the number of items
to variable `numItemsProcessed`.

#### JSONPath Map State

```
"Validate-All": {
  "Type": "Map",
  "InputPath": "$.detail",
  "ItemsPath": "$.shipped",
  "MaxConcurrency": 0,
  "ItemProcessor": {
    "StartAt": "Validate",
    "States": {
      "Validate": {
        "Type": "Task",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:ship-val",
        "End": true
      }
    }
  },
  "ResultPath": "$.detail.shipped",
  "End": true
}

```

In the previous example, the "ship-val" Lambda function will be executed
once for each element of the "shipped" field. The input to one iteration
will be:

```
{
  "prod": "R31",
  "dest-code": 9511,
  "quantity": 1344
}

```

Suppose that the "ship-val" function also needs access to the shipment’s
courier, which would be the same in each iteration. The "ItemSelector"
field may be used to construct the raw input for each iteration:

```
"Validate-All": {
  "Type": "Map",
  "InputPath": "$.detail",
  "ItemsPath": "$.shipped",
  "MaxConcurrency": 0,
  "ItemSelector": {
    "parcel.$": "$$.Map.Item.Value",
    "courier.$": "$.delivery-partner"
  },
  "ItemProcessor": {
    "StartAt": "Validate",
    "States": {
      "Validate": {
        "Type": "Task",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:ship-val",
        "End": true
      }
    }
  },
  "ResultPath": "$.detail.shipped",
  "End": true
}

```

The "ship-val" Lambda function will be executed once for each element of
the array selected by "ItemsPath". In the previous example, the raw input
to one iteration, as specified by "ItemSelector", will be:

```
{
  "parcel": {
    "prod": "R31",
    "dest-code": 9511,
    "quantity": 1344
   },
   "courier": "UQS"
}

```

In the previous examples, the ResultPath results in the output being the
same as the input, with the "detail.shipped" field being overwritten by
an array in which each element is the output of the "ship-val" Lambda
function as applied to the corresponding input element.

#### Map State input/output processing

In a JSONPath Map State, the "InputPath" field operates as usual, selecting part of the raw
input - in the example, the value of the "detail" field - to serve as
the effective input.

#### Reading Items

A Map State MAY have an "ItemReader" field, whose value MUST be a JSON
object and is called the ItemReader Configuration. The ItemReader
Configuration causes the interpreter to read items from the resource
identified by the ItemReader Configuration’s "Resource" field.

The ItemReader Configuration MUST have a "Resource" field, whose value
MUST be a URI that uniquely identifies the specific task to execute. The
States Language does not constrain the URI scheme nor any other part of
the URI. The ItemReader Configuration MAY
have a "ReaderConfig" field whose value is a JSON object which MAY have
a "MaxItems" field which MUST be a positive integer. The interpreter MAY
define additional "ReaderConfig" fields.

In a JSONata Map State, the ItemReader Configuration MAY have an
"Arguments" field, whose value MUST be a JSON object or a JSONata
string that evaluates to a JSON object.

In a JSONPath Map State, the ItemReader Configuration MAY have a
"Parameters" field, whose value MUST be a Payload Template.

The ItemReader Configuration causes the interpreter to read items from
the task identified by the ItemReader’s "Resource" field. The
interpreter will limit the number of items to the maximum number of
items specified by the ReaderConfig’s "MaxItems" field. The "MaxItems"
can be provided indirectly.

In a JSONata Map State, the "ReaderConfig" field's "MaxItems" field
MAY be a JSONata string that MUST evaluate to a positive integer.

In a JSONPath Map State, a "ReaderConfig" field MAY have
"MaxItemsPath" field which MUST be a Reference Path which, when
resolved, MUST select a field whose value is a positive integer. A
"ReaderConfig" field MUST NOT include both "MaxItems" and
"MaxItemsPath".

In a JSONata Map State, the default result for "ItemReader" is the
whole state input.

In a JSONPath Map State, the default result for "ItemReader" is "$",
which is to say the whole effective input.

#### Selecting Items

A JSONata Map State MAY have an "Items" field, whose value MUST be a
JSON array or a JSONata string that MUST evaluate to a JSON array,
which is called the Items Array. The default value of "Items" is the
whole ItemReader result. If a Map State has neither an
"ItemReader" nor an "Items" field, the items array will be the state
input, which MUST be a JSON array.

A JSONPath Map State MAY have an "ItemsPath" field, whose value MUST be a
Reference Path. The Reference Path is applied to the ItemReader result
and MUST identify a field whose value is a JSON array, which is called
the Items Array. The default value
of "ItemsPath" is "$", which is to say the whole
ItemReader result. If a Map State has neither an "InputPath" nor an
"ItemReader" nor an "ItemsPath" field, the items array will be the raw
input, which MUST be a JSON array.

A JSONata Map State MAY have an "ItemSelector" field, whose value MUST
be a JSON text, or a JSONata string that evaluates to a JSON text.

A JSONPath Map State MAY have an "ItemSelector" field, whose value
MUST be a Payload Template.

The interpreter uses the "ItemSelector" field to override each single
element of the item array. The result of the "ItemSelector" field is
called the selected item.

In a JSONPath Map State, the "ItemSelector" field performs the same
function as the "Parameters" field, which is now deprecated in the Map
State.

The default of "ItemSelector" is a single element of the Items Array.

#### Batching Items

A Map State MAY have an "ItemBatcher" field, whose value MUST be a JSON
object and is called the ItemBatcher Configuration. The ItemBatcher
Configuration causes the interpreter to batch selected items into
sub-arrays before passing them to each invocation. The interpreter will
limit each sub-array to the maximum number of items specified by the
"MaxItemsPerBatch" field, and to the maximum size in bytes specified by
the "MaxInputBytesPerBatch" field.

In a JSONata Map State, the ItemBatcher Configuration MAY have a
"BatchInput" field, whose value MUST be JSON text or a JSONata
string that MUST evaluate to a JSON text. In a JSONPath Map
State, the ItemBatcher Configuration MAY have a "BatchInput" field,
whose value MUST be a Payload Template.

An ItemBatcher Configuration MAY have a
"MaxItemsPerBatch" field, whose value MUST be a positive integer. An
ItemBatcher Configuration MAY have a "MaxInputBytesPerBatch" field,
whose value MUST be a positive integer.

The default of "ItemBatcher" is the selected item. Put another way, the
interpreter will not batch items if no "ItemBatcher" field is provided.

Both the "MaxItemsPerBatch" and "MaxInputBytesPerBatch" can be provided
indirectly.

A JSONata Map State MAY specify JSONata strings for the
"MaxItemsPerBatch" or "MaxInputBytesPerBatch" fields, which MUST
evaluate to positive integers.

A JSONPath Map State MAY have "MaxItemsPerBatchPath" and
"MaxInputBytesPerBatchPath" fields which MUST be Reference Paths which,
when resolved, MUST select fields whose values are positive integers. A
Map State MUST NOT include both "MaxItemsPerBatch" and
"MaxItemsPerBatchPath" or both "MaxInputBytesPerBatch" and
"MaxInputBytesPerBatchPath".

An ItemBatcher Configuration MUST contain at least one of
"MaxItemsPerBatch", "MaxItemsPerBatchPath", "MaxInputBytesPerBatch", or
"MaxInputBytesPerBatchPath".

#### Processing Items

The input to each invocation, by default, is a single element of the
Items Array, but may be overridden
using the "ItemSelector" and/or "ItemBatcher" fields. If present, the
interpreter uses the "ItemSelector" field to override each single
element of the Items Array to
produce an array of selected items. If present, the interpreter then
uses the "ItemBatcher" field to specify how to batch the selected items
array to produce an array of batched selected items.

For each item, within the Map State’s "ItemSelector" (or deprecated
"Parameters") field, the Context Object will have an object field named
"Map" which contains an object field named "Item" which in turn contains
an integer field named "Index" whose value is the (zero-based) array
index being processed and a field named "Value", whose value is the
array element being processed.

#### Writing Results

A Map State MAY have a "ResultWriter" field, whose value MUST be a JSON
object and is called the ResultWriter Configuration. The ResultWriter
Configuration causes the interpreter to write results to the resource
identified by the ResultWriter’s "Resource" field.

The ResultWriter Configuration MUST have a "Resource" field, whose value
MUST be a URI that uniquely identifies the specific task to execute. The
States Language does not constrain the URI scheme nor any other part of
the URI.

In a JSONata Map State, the ResultWriter Configuration MAY have an
"Arguments" field, whose value MUST be a JSON object or a JSONata
string that evaluates to a JSON object.

In a JSONPath Map State, the ResultWriter Configuration MAY have a
"Parameters" field, whose value MUST be a Payload Template.

If a "ResultWriter" field is provided, a Map State’s result is a JSON
object containing fields defined by the interpreter. If a "ResultWriter"
field is not specified, the result is a JSON array, whose value is
either an array containing one element for each element of the Items Array,
in the same order (if an "ItemBatcher" field is not
specified), or an array containing one element for each batched
sub-array of the Items Array, in the same order (if an
"ItemBatcher" field is specified).

#### Map State concurrency

A Map State MAY have a non-negative integer "MaxConcurrency" field. Its
default value is zero, which places no limit on invocation parallelism
and requests the interpreter to execute the iterations as concurrently
as possible.

If "MaxConcurrency" has a non-zero value, the interpreter will not allow
the number of concurrent iterations to exceed that value.

A MaxConcurrency value of 1 is special, having the effect that
interpreter will invoke the ItemProcessor once for each array element in
the order of their appearance in the input, and will not start an
iteration until the previous iteration has completed execution.

The "MaxConcurrency" can be provided indirectly.

A JSONata Map State MAY specify a JSONata string for the
"MaxConcurrency" field, which MUST evaluate to a non-negative integer.

A JSONPath Map State MAY have
"MaxConcurrencyPath" field which MUST be a Reference Path which, when
resolved, MUST select a field whose value is a non-negative integer. A
Map State MUST NOT include both "MaxConcurrency" and
"MaxConcurrencyPath".

#### Map State ItemProcessor definition

A Map State MUST contain an object field named "ItemProcessor" (or
deprecated "Iterator") which MUST contain fields named "States" and
"StartAt", whose meanings are exactly like those in the top level of a
State Machine. The "ItemProcessor" field performs the same function as
the "Iterator" field, which is now deprecated in the Map State.

The "ItemProcessor" field MAY contain a field named "ProcessorConfig",
whose value MUST be a JSON object whose value is defined by the
interpreter. The interpreter will execute the ItemProcessor according to
the ProcessorConfig.

A state in the "States" field of an "ItemProcessor" field MUST NOT have
a "Next" field that targets a field outside of that "States" field. A
state MUST NOT have a "Next" field which matches a state name inside an
"ItemProcessor" field’s "States" field unless it is also inside the same
"States" field.

Put another way, states in an ItemProcessor's "States" field can
transition only to each other, and no state outside of that "States"
field can transition into it.

If any iteration fails, due to an unhandled error or by transitioning to
a Fail state, the entire Map State is considered to have failed and all
the iterations are terminated. If the error is not handled by the Map
State, the interpreter should terminate the machine execution with an
error.

Unlike a Fail State, a Succeed State within a Map merely terminates its
own iteration. A Succeed State passes its input through as its output,
possibly modified by "Output" for JSONata, or "InputPath" and "OutputPath"
for JSONPath.

#### Map State Failure Tolerance

A Map State MAY have a "ToleratedFailurePercentage" field whose value
MUST be a number between zero and 100. Its default value is zero, which
means the Map State will fail if any (i.e. more than 0%) of its items
fail. A "ToleratedFailurePercentage" value of 100 means the interpreter
will continue starting iterations even if all items fail.

A Map State MAY have a non-negative integer "ToleratedFailureCount"
field. Its default value is zero, which means the Map State will fail if
at least 1 of its items fail. If a "ToleratedFailurePercentage" field
and a "ToleratedFailureCount" field are both specified, the Map State
will fail if either threshold is breached.

Both the "ToleratedFailureCount" and "ToleratedFailurePercentage" can be
provided indirectly.

A JSONata Map State MAY specify JSONata strings for the
"ToleratedFailureCount" and "ToleratedFailurePercentage" fields, which
MUST evaluate to non-negative integers.

A JSONPath Map State may have "ToleratedFailureCountPath"
and "ToleratedFailurePercentagePath" fields which MUST be Reference
Paths which, when resolved, MUST select fields whose values are
non-negative integers. A Map State MUST NOT include both
"ToleratedFailureCount" and "ToleratedFailureCountPath" or both
"ToleratedFailurePercentage" and "ToleratedFailurePercentagePath".

### Appendix B: List of JSONPath Intrinsic Functions

The States Language provides a set of intrinsic functions that provide
additional functionality for JSONPath. Intrinsic functions MAY be
used in states that use the JSONPath query language, and MUST NOT be
used in states that use any other query language.

#### States.Format

This Intrinsic Function takes one or more arguments. The Value of the
first MUST be a string, which MAY include zero or more instances of the
character sequence `{}`. There MUST be as many remaining arguments in
the Intrinsic Function as there are occurrences of `{}`. The interpreter
returns the first-argument string with each `{}` replaced by the Value
of the positionally-corresponding argument in the Intrinsic Function.

If necessary, the `{` and `}` characters can be escaped respectively as
`\\{` and `\\}`.

If the argument is a Path, applying it to the input MUST yield a value
that is a string, a boolean, a number, or `null`. In each case, the
Value is the natural string representation; string values are not
accompanied by enclosing `"` characters. The Value MUST NOT be a JSON
array or object.

For example, given the following Payload Template:

```
{
  "Parameters": {
    "foo.$": "States.Format('Your name is {}, we are in the year {}', $.name, 2020)"
  }
}

```

Suppose the input to the Payload Template is as follows:

```
{
  "name": "Foo",
  "zebra": "stripe"
}

```

After processing the Payload Template, the new payload becomes:

```
{
  "foo": "Your name is Foo, we are in the year 2020"
}

```

#### States.StringToJson

This Intrinsic Function takes a single argument whose Value MUST be a
string. The interpreter applies a JSON parser to the Value and returns
its parsed JSON form.

For example, given the following Payload Template:

```
{
  "Parameters": {
    "foo.$": "States.StringToJson($.someString)"
  }
}

```

Suppose the input to the Payload Template is as follows:

```
{
  "someString": "{\"number\": 20}",
  "zebra": "stripe"
}

```

After processing the Payload Template, the new payload becomes:

```
{
  "foo": {
    "number": 20
  }
}

```

#### States.JsonToString

This Intrinsic Function takes a single argument which MUST be a Path.
The interpreter returns a string which is a JSON text representing the
data identified by the Path.

For example, given the following Payload Template:

```
{
  "Parameters": {
    "foo.$": "States.JsonToString($.someJson)"
  }
}

```

Suppose the input to the Payload Template is as follows:

```
{
  "someJson": {
    "name": "Foo",
    "year": 2020
  },
  "zebra": "stripe"
}

```

After processing the Payload Template, the new payload becomes:

```
{
  "foo": "{\"name\":\"Foo\",\"year\":2020}"
}

```

#### States.Array

This Intrinsic Function takes zero or more arguments. The interpreter
returns a JSON array containing the Values of the arguments, in the
order provided.

For example, given the following Payload Template:

```
{
  "Parameters": {
    "foo.$": "States.Array('Foo', 2020, $.someJson, null)"
  }
}

```

Suppose the input to the Payload Template is as follows:

```
{
  "someJson": {
    "random": "abcdefg"
  },
  "zebra": "stripe"
}

```

After processing the Payload Template, the new payload becomes:

```
{
  "foo": [
    "Foo",
    2020,
    {
      "random": "abcdefg"
    },
    null
  ]
}

```

#### States.ArrayPartition

Use the `States.ArrayPartition` intrinsic function to partition a large
array or to slice the data and then send
the payload in smaller chunks.

This intrinsic function takes two arguments. The first argument is an
array, while the second argument defines the chunk size. The interpreter
chunks the input array into multiple arrays of the size specified by
chunk size. The length of the last array chunk may be less than the
length of the previous array chunks if the number of remaining items in
the array is smaller than the chunk size.

**Input validation**

* The first argument MUST be an array.
* The second argument MUST be a non-zero, positive integer,
  representing the chunk size value.

For example, given the following input array:

```
{ "inputArray": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] }

```

Use the `States.ArrayPartition` function to divide the array
into chunks of four values:

```
{ "inputArray.$": "States.ArrayPartition($.inputArray,4)" }

```

Which would return the following array chunks:

```
{ "inputArray": [ [1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9]] }

```

In the previous example, the `States.ArrayPartition` function outputs
three arrays. The first two arrays each contain four values, as defined
by the chunk size. A third array contains the remaining value and is
smaller than the defined chunk size.

#### States.ArrayContains

Use the `States.ArrayContains` intrinsic function to determine if a
specific value is present in an array. For example, use this
function to detect if there was an error in a `Map` state iteration.

This intrinsic function takes two arguments. The first argument is an
array, while the second argument is the value to be searched for within
the array.

**Input validation**

* The first argument MUST be an array
* The second argument MUST be a JSON object

For example, given the following input array:

```
{ "inputArray": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], "lookingFor": 5 }

```

Use the `States.ArrayContains` function to find
the `lookingFor` value within the `inputArray`:

```
{ "contains.$": "States.ArrayContains($.inputArray, $.lookingFor)" }

```

Because the value stored in `lookingFor` is included in
the `inputArray`, `States.ArrayContains` returns the following result:

```
{ "contains": true }

```

#### States.ArrayRange

Use the `States.ArrayRange` intrinsic function to create a new array
containing a specific range of elements. The new array can contain up to
1000 elements.

This function takes three arguments. The first argument is the first
element of the new array, the second argument is the final element of
the new array, and the third argument is the increment value between the
elements in the new array.

**Input validation**

* All arguments MUST be integer values.
* The third argument MUST NOT be zero.
* The newly generated array MUST NOT contain more than 1000 items.

For example, the following use of the `States.ArrayRange` function will
create an array with a first value of 1, a final value of 9, and values
in between the first and final values increase by two for each item:

```
{ "array.$": "States.ArrayRange(1, 9, 2)" }

```

Which would return the following array:

```
{ "array": [1,3,5,7,9] }

```

#### States.ArrayGetItem

This intrinsic function returns a specified index's value. This function
takes two arguments. The first argument is an array of values and the
second argument is the array index of the value to return.

For example, use the following `inputArray` and `index` values:

```
{ "inputArray": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], "index": 5 }

```

Use the `States.ArrayGetItem` function to
return the value in the `index` position 5 within the array:

```
{ "item.$": "States.ArrayGetItem($.inputArray, $.index)" }

```

In this example, `States.ArrayGetItem` would return the following
result:

```
{ "item": 6 }

```

#### States.ArrayLength

The `States.ArrayLength` intrinsic function returns the length of an
array. It has one argument, the array to return the length of.

For example, given the following input array:

```
{ "inputArray": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] }

```

Use `States.ArrayLength` to return the length of `inputArray`:

```
{ "length.$": "States.ArrayLength($.inputArray)" }

```

In this example, `States.ArrayLength` would return the following JSON
object that represents the array length:

```
{ "length": 9 }

```

#### States.ArrayUnique

The `States.ArrayUnique` intrinsic function removes duplicate values
from an array and returns an array containing only unique elements. This
function takes an array, which can be unsorted, as its sole argument.

For example, the following `inputArray` contains a series of duplicate
values:

```
{ "inputArray": [1,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4] }

```

The `States.ArrayUnique` function can be used to remove duplicate
values from the array:

```
{ "array.$": "States.ArrayUnique($.inputArray)" }

```

The `States.ArrayUnique` function would return the following array
containing only unique elements, removing all duplicate values:

```
{ "array": [1,2,3,4] }

```

#### States.Base64Encode

Use the `States.Base64Encode` intrinsic function to encode data based on
MIME Base64 encoding scheme. For example, use this function to pass data to
other AWS services without using an AWS Lambda function.

This function takes a data string of up to 10,000 characters to encode
as its only argument.

For example, consider the following `input` string:

```
{ "input": "Data to encode" }

```

Use the `States.Base64Encode` function to encode
the `input` string as a MIME Base64 string:

```
{ "base64.$": "States.Base64Encode($.input)" }

```

The `States.Base64Encode` function returns the following encoded data in
response:

```
{ "base64": "RGF0YSB0byBlbmNvZGU=" }

```

#### States.Base64Decode

Use the `States.Base64Decode` intrinsic function to decode data based on
MIME Base64 decoding scheme. For example, use this function to pass data to
other AWS services without using a Lambda function.

This function takes a Base64 encoded data string of up to 10,000
characters to decode as its only argument.

For example, given the following input:

```
{ "base64": "RGF0YSB0byBlbmNvZGU=" }

```

Use the `States.Base64Decode` function to decode the base64
string to a human-readable string:

```
{ "data.$": "States.Base64Decode($.base64)" }

```

The `States.Base64Decode function` would return the following decoded
data in response:

```
{ "data": "Decoded data" }

```

#### States.Hash

Use the `States.Hash` intrinsic function to calculate the hash value of
a given input. For example, use this function to pass data to other AWS
services without using a Lambda function.

This function takes two arguments. The first argument is the data to
hash. The length of the stringified version of the first argument must
be 10,000 characters or less. The second argument is the hashing
algorithm to use to perform the hash calculation.

The hashing algorithm can be any of the following
algorithms:

* MD5
* SHA-1
* SHA-256
* SHA-384
* SHA-512

For example, given the `Data` string and a specific `Algorithm`:

```
{ "Data": "input data", "Algorithm": "SHA-1" }

```

Use the `States.Hash` function to calculate the hash value:

```
{ "output.$": "States.Hash($.Data, $.Algorithm)" }

```

The `States.Hash` function returns the following hash value in response:

```
{ "output": "aaff4a450a104cd177d28d18d7485e8cae074b7" }

```

#### States.JsonMerge

Use the `States.JsonMerge` intrinsic function to merge two JSON objects
into a single object. This function takes three arguments. The first two
arguments are the JSON objects to merge. The third argument
is a boolean value that is `false` to do a shallow merge, and `true` to do
a deep merge.

In shallow
mode, if the same field name exists in both JSON objects, the latter object's
field overrides the field with the same name in the first object.

In deep mode, if the same field name exists in both JSON objects, and
both fields are themselves JSON objects, the function merges them.
Deep mode repeats this process recursively.

For example, use the `States.JsonMerge` function to merge the
following JSON arrays that both have a field named `a`.

```
{
  "json1": { "a": {"a1": 1, "a2": 2}, "b": 2, },
  "json2": { "a": {"a3": 1, "a4": 2}, "c": 3 }
}

```

Specify the `json1` and `json2` arrays as inputs in
the `States.JasonMerge` function to merge them together:

```
{ "output.$": "States.JsonMerge($.json1, $.json2, false)" }

```

The `States.JsonMerge` returns the following merged JSON object as
result. In the merged JSON object `output`, the `json2` object's
field `a` replaces the `json1` object's field `a`. Also, the nested object
in `json1` object's field `a` is discarded because shallow mode does not
support merging nested objects.

```
{ "output": { "a": {"a3": 1, "a4": 2}, "b": 2, "c": 3 } }

```

#### States.MathRandom

Use the `States.MathRandom` intrinsic function to return a random number
between the specified start and end number. For example, use
this function to distribute a specific task between two or more
resources.

This function takes three arguments. The first argument is the start
number, the second argument is the end number, and the last argument
controls the seed value. The seed value argument is optional.

Each use of this function with the same seed value will produce the
same result.

Important

Because the `States.MathRandom` function does not return
cryptographically secure random numbers, we recommend not to use
it for security sensitive applications.

**Input validation**

* The start number and end number MUST be integers.

For example, to generate a random number from between one and 999,
use the following input values:

```
{ "start": 1, "end": 999 }

```

To generate the random number, provide the `start` and `end` values to
the `States.MathRandom` function:

```
{ "random.$": "States.MathRandom($.start, $.end)" }

```

The `States.MathRandom` function returns the following random number as
a response:

```
{ "random": 456 }

```

#### States.MathAdd

Use the `States.MathAdd` intrinsic function to return the sum of two
numbers. For example, use this function to increment values
inside a loop without invoking a Lambda function.

**Input validation**

* All arguments MUST be integers.

For example, use the following values to subtract one from 111:

```
{ "value1": 111, "step": -1 }

```

Then, use the `States.MathAdd` function defining `value1` as the
starting value, and `step` as the value to increment `value1` by:

```
{ "value1.$": "States.MathAdd($.value1, $.step)" }

```

The `States.MathAdd` function would return the following number in
response:

```
{ "value1": 110 }

```

#### States.StringSplit

Use the `States.StringSplit` intrinsic function to split a string into
an array of values. This function takes two arguments. The first argument
is a string and the second argument is the delimiting character that the
function will use to divide the string.

For example, use `States.StringSplit` to divide the
following `inputString`, which contains a series of comma separated
values:

```
{ "inputString": "1,2,3,4,5", "splitter": "," }

```

Use the `States.StringSplit` function and define `inputString` as the
first argument, and the delimiting character `splitter` as the second
argument:

```
{ "array.$": "States.StringSplit($.inputString, $.splitter)" }

```

The `States.StringSplit` function returns the following string array as
result:

```
{ "array": ["1","2","3","4","5"] }

```

#### States.UUID

Use the `States.UUID` intrinsic function to return a version 4
universally unique identifier (v4 UUID) generated using random numbers.
For example, use this function to call other AWS services or
resources that need a UUID parameter or insert items in a DynamoDB
table.

The `States.UUID` function is called with no arguments specified:

```
{ "uuid.$": "States.UUID()" }

```

The function returns a randomly generated UUID, for
example:

```
{ "uuid": "ca4c1140-dcc1-40cd-ad05-7b4aa23df4a8" }

```
